## Language Deprivation

Language deprivation means being denied access to a natural language during the language acquisition period (0 - 5 years) [[1]](#1). 

## Who does this affect?

There are many famous examples of this happening to hearing children whom were neglected or lost and not exposed to language. The less talked about but more common example is that of deaf children who were not exposed to sign language at an early age. 

## Pathological framework that parents face
The current approach for educating parents about their deaf child is biased and can often lead to language deprivation for their deaf children. Parents are often under the impression that cochlear implants are the only option for their deaf child to acquire language, however "receiving a cochlear implant... between one and two years of age does not guarantee normal spoken language skills five years after implantation: non-signing implanted children can display significant language deficits relative to their hearing peers, including lower vocabulary knowledge and inconsistent speech production/perception" [[2]](#2)

## What is incidental learning?

Incidental learning refers to any learning that is unplanned or unintended. It develops while engaging in a task or activity and may arise as a byproduct of planned learning. 75% - 80% of learning happens incidentally during a childs early years. Hearing children grow up in households where they have unlimitted access to information gained auditorally. For a deaf child, they are unable to access incidental learning in the same way when language deprivation occurs. [[1]](#1)
