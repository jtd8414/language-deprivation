## Language Deprivation

Language deprivation means being denied access to a natural language during the language acquisition period (0 - 5 years) [[1]](#1). 

## Who does this affect?

There are many famous examples of this happening to hearing children whom were neglected or lost and not exposed to language. The less talked about but more common example is that of deaf children who were not exposed to sign language at an early age. The current approach for educating parents about their deaf child is biased and can often lead to language deprivation.

## What is incidental learning?
Incidental learning refers to any learning that is unplanned or unintended. It develops while engaging in a task or activity and may arise as a byproduct of planned learning [[1]](#1).
