## Language Deprivation

Language deprivation means being denied access to a natural language during the language acquisition period (0 - 5 years) [[1]](#1). 

## Who does this affect?

There are many famous examples of this happening to hearing children who were neglected or lost and not exposed to language. The less talked about but more common example is that of deaf children who were not exposed to sign language at an early age. Language deprivation "can cause cognitive delays and mental health difficulties across the lifespan. Mental health clinicians often see language deprivation and language dysfluency being a common “symptom” in deaf individuals who seek treatment, and are subsequently admitted to inpatient hospitals" [[2]](#2).

## Pathological framework that parents face

The current approach for educating parents about their deaf child is biased and can often lead to language deprivation. Parents are often under the impression that cochlear implants are the only option for their deaf child to acquire language, however "receiving a cochlear implant... between one and two years of age does not guarantee normal spoken language skills five years after implantation: non-signing implanted children can display significant language deficits relative to their hearing peers, including lower vocabulary knowledge and inconsistent speech production/perception" [[2]](#2). By teaching a deaf child to hear (via a cochlear implant) while at the same time learning a spoken language while having no language of their own is more burdensome and harmful to the child than already having a growing language foundation that can be used to help cochlear implant skill development [[1]](#1).

## Preventing language deprivation

Instead of directly implanting a cochlear implant into a deaf child, if a parent instead teaches sign language as a deaf child's first language, language deprivation is less likely to occur. Additionally, this does not prevent a deaf child from receiving a cochlear implant later in life. In fact, "without a period of language deprivation before the implantation of the cochlear implant, children with cochlear implants can develop spoken language skills appropriate for [their age]… sign language input does no harm to a deaf child’s spoken language development after h/she receives an implant" [[2]](#2). Teaching sign language allows deaf children the ability to develop language naturally and allows for incidental learning to occur when the deaf child is immersed in sign language at an early age.

## What is incidental learning?

Incidental learning refers to any learning that is unplanned or unintended. It develops while engaging in a task or activity and may arise as a byproduct of planned learning. 75% - 80% of learning happens incidentally during a child's early years. Hearing children grow up in households where they have unlimited access to information gained auditorily. For a deaf child, they are unable to access incidental learning in the same way when language deprivation occurs [[1]](#1). By using sign language in the environment a deaf child grows up in, it allows the deaf child to notice information they might not have otherwise gleaned. 

## Resources for learning ASL

If a parent is hearing and does not know American Sign Language (ASL) it can seem quite daunting learning an entire new language to prevent language deprivation. This is often why parents choose to lean towards leveraging a cochlear implant. But there are many tools to help children and their families learn sign language.
- You can request American Sign Language instruction from your child’s early intervention system.

## Synopsis
Dr. Wyatte C. Hall writing for the "Maternal and Child Health Journal" frames it clearly:
> The lifelong consequences of language deprivation are too far-reaching, from early childhood to adulthood, to limit a deaf child’s time-sensitive language acquisition opportunities. Rather than focusing on auditory deprivation and speech skills, developmental approaches for deaf children should prioritize healthy, expected development of all developmental domains (e.g., cognitive, academic, socio-emotional) that comes with the guaranteed full acquisition of a fully accessible first-language language foundation such as sign language [[2]](#2).
